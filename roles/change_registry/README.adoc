= change_registry Ansible Role

Allows one to update an existing pull secret, ImageContentSourcePolicy, and CatalogSource to point to a new registry URL

== Requirements

KUBECONFIG is defined and logged in.

== Role Variables

include::roles/change_registry/defaults/main.yml[]

== Dependencies

kubernetes.core

== Known Issues

- Seems to have problems with content size on ICSP because last-applied-configuration duplicates the content. Mayneed to just remove that field or remove the object entirely.

- Would be good to add a pause to MCP rollout before and after applying changes to allow them to be one sync.
